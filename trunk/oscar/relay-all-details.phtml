        <h3><? PutLibPhotoRandomPlaced("sasquatch",1,"right"); ?>What is <i>Relay all</i>?</h3>
        <p>OSCAR realizes that it might not be convenient for you to 
           check off <i>all</i> of your schedule selections in one sitting, so OSCAR only relays a member's data <i>if</i>
           you have made your intentions for that member clear.</p>
        <p>If you don't check any of the boxes next to or under a member's entry, OSCAR does <i>not</i> consider your
           intentions for that member to be clear, so OSCAR won't relay anything about that member to any squad schedule 
           coordinator.</p>
        <p>But what if you don't want to allocate <i>any</i> of a member's availabilities for EMS use?&nbsp; What if you
           want to relay <i>all</i> of a member's availabilities to that member's squad?</p>
        <p>That's where the <b>Relay all</b> feature comes in.&nbsp; By checking <b>Relay all</b> next to a member's
           name, you are telling OSCAR to relay all of that member's availabilities to his or her squad.</p>
        <p>In other words, <b>Relay all</b> tells OSCAR that you <i>deliberately</i> did not allocate any of a member's
           availabilities, and you <i>want</i> OSCAR to relay that member's availability sheet to his or her squad.</p>

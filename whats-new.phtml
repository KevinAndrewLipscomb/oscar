        <p><b>2001-11-16:&nbsp; </b>Major enhancements to support availability coordination at both the department and 
           squad/team levels.&nbsp; Features will be activated on per-agency basis via database updates at direction of 
           EMS-2.&nbsp; Added availability summaries to the full reports that authorities get.&nbsp; Added failsafe
           submission recovery mechanism in case database becomes unavailable at any critical time after a
           submission.&nbsp; Added much more robust handling of database-down conditions.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-13:&nbsp; </b>Revised report generator so that OSCAR authorities will be able to see the "# extras 
           will run" values at first glance in their versions of the full reports, rather than making them drill down per
           person.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-12:&nbsp; </b>Revised report generator to report the latest submitted note (versus first or arbitrary) for 
           each person.&nbsp; Added the <a href=stats.phtml>Detailed stats</a> page.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-08:&nbsp; </b>Revised main page to handle database-down condition gracefully.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-05:&nbsp; </b>Improved retraction handling.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-04:&nbsp; </b>Added the "Server status" indication on the main page.&nbsp; This feature forces a hit
           on the database, thereby assuring that both PHP and MySQL are up, and provides a keyword ("A-OK") that some
           site monitoring services will check for.&nbsp; Added clarifications for "surrogate" submitters.&nbsp; Added
           Zone Car ALS handling.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-03:&nbsp; </b>Fixed a bug noticed during a demo that was preventing legitimate OSCAR authorities from
           gaining access to special request comments.&nbsp; Made authority and role tracking more robust.</p>
        <p><b>2001-11-01:&nbsp; </b>Fixed bug 477171, which had been causing the dates shown on the standard submission 
           confirmation page to be off (earlier) by one day than the dates the user actually submitted.&nbsp; This bug had
           been introduced when TDA handling was added.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-31:&nbsp; </b>Went live as www.Oscarsystem.com.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-29:&nbsp; </b>Began round-the-clock site response monitoring, with pager notification to the OSCAR
           Sysadmin.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-27:&nbsp; </b>Added ERS TDA handling.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-25:&nbsp; </b>Demonstrated the system to VBDEMS.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-23:&nbsp; </b>Added the <a href=privacy.phtml>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=develop.phtml>How to 
           contribute</a> pages.</p>
        <p><b>2001-10-21:&nbsp; </b>Achieved Initial Operating Capability (IOC).</p>
